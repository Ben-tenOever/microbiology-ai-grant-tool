Post-transcriptional and Translational Research RNA Biology / mRNA Decay / Epitranscriptomics The Belasco Lab investigates the mechanisms of mRNA decay and RNA modification in bacteria and mammals, focusing on how molecular interactions at the 5′ end and along the transcript body determine mRNA stability and epitranscriptomic modification. The lab’s pioneering studies have defined fundamental principles of bacterial mRNA decay, including the discovery of the 5′-end-dependent mRNA degradation pathway and the identification of novel bacterial RNA caps—such as glucose and nucleoside-tetraphosphate (Np₄) caps—that modulate transcript stability. Using a combination of biochemical reconstitution and single-molecule imaging, the lab has shown that RNase E scans RNA by one-dimensional diffusion, with obstacles such as proteins, ribosomes, or structured RNA elements hindering cleavage and stabilizing transcripts. Collectively, these studies reveal universal mechanisms linking RNA structure, enzymology, and environmental stress to post-transcriptional gene regulation across domains of life. Current efforts center on uncovering new types of RNA 5′-end modifications, defining their biosynthetic origins and regulatory consequences, and exploring whether analogous decay and capping mechanisms operate in mammalian systems.

Drivers of Microbial Pathogenesis Bacteriology / Stress Responses / Cell Envelope Physiology The Darwin Lab investigates the physiology of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell envelope, with emphasis on stress responses, carboxyl-terminal processing proteases, and mechanisms regulating autolysins involved in peptidoglycan remodeling. The lab’s work has defined how the LbcA•CtpA proteolytic complex maintains cell envelope integrity by degrading specific peptidoglycan hydrolases that are essential for cell wall expansion and morphogenesis. Through genetic, biochemical, and structural studies, the lab has revealed that CtpA forms a hexameric complex activated by its lipoprotein partner LbcA, a mechanism distinct from the analogous E. coli NlpI•Prc system. These studies have uncovered a broader network of envelope proteases and regulatory proteins, including inhibitor/anti-inhibitor systems (e.g., IltA/LiiA) that fine-tune the activity of lytic transglycosylases. Collectively, this work defines fundamental principles of bacterial envelope homeostasis and provides insight into the growth-rate-dependent control of proteolysis, stress adaptation, and antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa. Current efforts focus on elucidating how envelope protease systems sense physiological stress, coordinate with phospholipid transport pathways, and modulate cell wall remodeling during infection and antibiotic challenge.

Drivers of Microbial Pathogenesis
Post-transcriptional and Translational Research Bacteriology / Post-Translational Regulation / Proteostasis / Host-Pathogen Interactions The Darwin Lab investigates the biology and biochemistry of the mycobacterial Pup-proteasome system (PPS) and its regulated pathways, uncovering how this bacterial proteostasis network contributes to stress adaptation, metabolism, and virulence. The group studies protein quality control and proteasome-mediated degradation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with emphasis on how Pup modification and depupylation govern protein stability and stress responses. The lab’s pioneering work revealed that the Pup ligase PafA catalyzes substrate-to-substrate “transpupylation,” a mechanism distinct from eukaryotic ubiquitination. Subsequent studies identified Ruc, a redox-regulated molecular chaperone that protects M. tuberculosis from oxidative stress, and defined how the depupylase Dop controls substrate selectivity through a conserved catalytic loop. The group also showed that defective proteasomal degradation leads to aldehyde accumulation and hypersensitivity to nitric oxide and copper stress. Most recently, they discovered that CoaX, a pseudopantothenate kinase, links metabolic state to proteasome regulation by modulating Dop-mediated depupylation of PanB. Current efforts focus on defining how Pup-proteasome dynamics and redox-regulated chaperones coordinate bacterial stress adaptation, metabolic control, and persistence during infection.

Post-transcriptional and Translational Research
Translational Research Microbiology / Nuclear Receptor Signaling / Transcriptional Regulation / Chemical Biology / Translational Therapeutics The Garabedian Lab investigates how nuclear receptor signaling is regulated by post-translational modifications, cofactors, and synthetic ligands to control gene expression programs in health and disease. Current studies span cardiometabolic, neurological, laryngeal, and prostate systems, revealing how nuclear receptor phosphorylation and cofactor interactions reprogram transcriptional networks to drive inflammation, memory formation, fibrosis, and cancer progression. The group has defined key mechanisms by which the androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) integrate signaling cues from cofactors such as MED19 and ELK1 to control chromatin accessibility and transcriptional output in prostate cancer. Pioneering studies identified how phosphorylation of LXRα influences macrophage lipid metabolism and inflammation, and how selective glucocorticoid signaling modulates fibrotic remodeling in vocal fold fibroblast–macrophage co-cultures. Current efforts focus on dissecting receptor–cofactor interactions, post-translational receptor modification, and the discovery of small-molecule and peptoid modulators that fine-tune nuclear receptor activity across diverse tissues and disease contexts.

      <p><strong>Lab synopsis:</strong> The Garabedian Lab investigates how nuclear receptor signaling is regulated by post-translational modifications, cofactors, and synthetic ligands to control gene expression programs in health and disease. Current studies span cardiometabolic, neurological, laryngeal, and prostate systems, revealing how nuclear receptor phosphorylation and cofactor interactions reprogram transcriptional networks to drive inflammation, memory formation, fibrosis, and cancer progression. The group has defined key mechanisms by which the androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) integrate signaling cues from cofactors such as MED19 and ELK1 to control chromatin accessibility and transcriptional output in prostate cancer. Pioneering studies identified how phosphorylation of LXRα influences macrophage lipid metabolism and inflammation, and how selective glucocorticoid signaling modulates fibrotic remodeling in vocal fold fibroblast–macrophage co-cultures. Current efforts focus on dissecting receptor–cofactor interactions, post-translational receptor modification, and the discovery of small-molecule and peptoid modulators that fine-tune nuclear receptor activity across diverse tissues and disease contexts.</p>

Virology Virology / Post-Transcriptional Gene Regulation / Stress Responses / RNA Biology The Mohr Lab investigates post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression under physiological stress using viral infection models, with a focus on RNA modification, ribosome biogenesis, and signaling pathways that control viral replication, host responses, and latency. The group defines how viruses—particularly herpesviruses—reprogram host RNA metabolism and translation to favor infection, evade immune defenses, and adapt to cellular stress. Their studies revealed that RNA m⁶A modification enzymes (e.g., METTL14, ALKBH5) regulate interferon-β expression during cytomegalovirus infection and DNA sensing, and that HSV-1 VP22 acts as a ribosome-associated factor maintaining translation under ribosomal stress. Using single-cell and multi-omic analyses, the lab also uncovered neuronal determinants such as Gadd45b that regulate HSV-1 latency and reactivation. Current efforts focus on defining how viral infection exploits and remodels RNA modification, translational control, and stress response networks to influence viral persistence, immune evasion, and cell fate.

      <p><strong>Lab synopsis:</strong> The Mohr Lab investigates post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression under physiological stress using viral infection models, with a focus on RNA modification, ribosome biogenesis, and signaling pathways that control viral replication, host responses, and latency. The group defines how viruses—particularly herpesviruses—reprogram host RNA metabolism and translation to favor infection, evade immune defenses, and adapt to cellular stress. Their studies revealed that RNA m⁶A modification enzymes (e.g., METTL14, ALKBH5) regulate interferon-β expression during cytomegalovirus infection and DNA sensing, and that HSV-1 VP22 acts as a ribosome-associated factor maintaining translation under ribosomal stress. Using single-cell and multi-omic analyses, the lab also uncovered neuronal determinants such as Gadd45b that regulate HSV-1 latency and reactivation. Current efforts focus on defining how viral infection exploits and remodels RNA modification, translational control, and stress response networks to influence viral persistence, immune evasion, and cell fate.</p>

These animal models are complemented by primary human cell and tissue systems to assess findings in clinically relevant contexts.

Research extends to Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and influenza A virus to define conserved mechanisms of airway pathogenesis. The lab integrates bacterial genetics, mucosal immunology, and population-level variation to understand how microbial traits—such as capsule structure, bacteriocin competition systems (BlpAB), and neuraminidase activity—govern mucosal persistence and transitions from commensal carriage to invasive disease. Recent studies revealed that neuraminidase-mediated mucus remodeling enhances colonization, Blp polymorphisms drive within-host competition and inflammation, and capsule diversity limits genetic exchange and immune recognition. Current efforts aim to delineate the bacterial and host factors that balance colonization and virulence and to identify strategies that prevent transmission, vaccine escape, and antibiotic resistance across respiratory pathogens.

Virology Virology / RNA Processing / Virus–Host Interactions The Wilson Lab uses viruses to uncover fundamental biological processes, with a focus on viral manipulation of host RNA processing, chromatin dynamics, and signaling pathways. The lab investigates how herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes latency and reactivation in neurons, integrating viral genetics, neuronal models, and spatial transcriptomics and proteomics to dissect virus–host interactions at single-cell resolution. Their studies revealed how TOP2β-dependent DNA damage and AKT–mTORC1 signaling maintain latency, while stress-induced shifts in neuronal homeostasis trigger viral reactivation. The group also examines how virus-induced changes in nuclear architecture and RNA metabolism alter the biophysical and transcriptional landscape of infected cells.
Current efforts focus on connecting host stress responses, epigenetic regulation, and viral gene expression to develop new strategies for controlling latency and reactivation in neurotropic viruses. Viruses as tools to uncover host biological mechanisms.
Viral manipulation of host RNA processing (splicing, modification, decay).
Spatial transcriptomics and proteomics of virus-infected cells.
Biophysical and chromatin reprogramming of host cells during infection.
Mechanisms distinguishing viral persistence, latency, and productive infection.
